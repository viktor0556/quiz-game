# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Built with

- [React](http://react.dev)

## Development

To get a local copy of the code, clone it using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/viktor0556/quiz-game.git
cd quiz-app
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

**Database setup:** The application uses PostgreSQL for database management. Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed on your system and create a database for the project.

Now, you can start a local web server by running:

```
cd frontend/ npm run dev
```
```
cd quiz-backend/ node server.js
```

And then open http://localhost:5173/ to view it in the browser.
